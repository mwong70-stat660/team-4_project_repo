[Dataset 1 Name] Ridership_200901

[Dataset Description] BART ridership, January 2009

[Experimental Unit Description] Ridership on weekday at a BART exit station in 
January 2009.

[Number of Observations] 1,849      

[Number of Features] 5

[Data Source] The file 
https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/ridership_2009.zip
was downloaded and transformed to produce file Ridership_200901_raw.xls by 
restructuring the "Weekday OD" worksheet. Excel was used to create the new
columns Year Month Exit Entry Riders that correspond to the Exit-Entry pairing 
from the worksheet "Weekday OD" and converted the file into XLS.

[Unique ID Schema] The columns "Year", "Month", "Exit", and "Entry" form a 
composite key, which together forms a unique id in dataset Ridership_200901. 
Each Exit station is paired with all Entry station. The composite key is the 
pair of Exit station and Entry station. The data set forms paired matrix of the 
average ridership for the month. Vertical union may lead us to understand the 
proportion use of the Entry stations compared to other Entry stations. 
Horizontal join may lead us to understand if there exist trends over time.
